# Introduction and Purpose of the website
Welcome to Computer Science Department Website,This Readme document provides comprehensive information about the Computer Science Department Website for the University of Ghana. The purpose of this website is to improve the existing website of the Computer Science Department and provide a user-friendly interface for students, faculty, and staff to access relevant information, resources, and updates related to the department.

# Cloning the Project:

1. Install Git:
 install Git on your machine. You can download it from Git's official website.

2. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:

On Windows, you can use Command Prompt or PowerShell.
On macOS and Linux, you can use the built-in terminal.

3. Navigate to the Desired Directory:

Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
cd path/to/desired/directory

4. Clone the Repository:

Copy the clone URL of the Git repository. You can usually find this on the repository page on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.
In the terminal, run the following command:

- git clone <repository-url>
Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL you copied.

5. Navigate into the Cloned Directory:

- cd <cloned-directory>
Replace <cloned-directory> with the name of the directory created during the cloning process.

# Set Up the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Project:
